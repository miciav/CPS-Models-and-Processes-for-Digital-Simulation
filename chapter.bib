abstract = {Design and operation of a manufacturing enterprise involve numerous types of decision-making at various levels and domains. A complex system has a large number of design variables and decision-making requires real-time data collected from machines, processes, and business environments. Enterprise systems (ESs) are used to support data acquisition, communication, and all decision-making activities. Therefore, information technology (IT) infrastructure for data acquisition and sharing affects the performance of an ES greatly. Our objective is to investigate the impact of emerging Internet of Things (IoT) on ESs in modern manufacturing. To achieve this objective, the evolution of manufacturing system paradigms is discussed to identify the requirements of decision support systems in dynamic and distributed environments; recent advances in IT are overviewed and associated with next-generation manufacturing paradigms; and the relation of IT infrastructure and ESs is explored to identify the technological gaps in adopting IoT as an IT infrastructure of ESs. The future research directions in this area are discussed.},

abstract = {Nowadays we live in a world,whicha decade ago would only be described in the science fiction literature. More and more things become smart and both scientists and engineers strive for developing not only new and innovative devices, but also homes, factories, or even cities. Despite of continuous development, many of those concepts are still being just a vision of the future, which still needs a lot of effort to become true. This paper reviews the usage of adjective smartin respect to technology and with a special emphasis on the smart factory concept placement among contemporary studies. Due to a lack of a consensus of common understanding of this term,a unified definition is proposed. The conceptualization will not only refer to varioussmart factory visions reported in the literature, but also link the crucial characteristics of this emerging manufacturing concept to usual manufacturing practice.Subsequently, the authors discuss the challenges of the potential smart factory applications in SMEs, and also propose a future research outlook in order to further develop the smart factory concept. ?? 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {The proliferation of cyber-physical systems introduces the fourth stage of industrialization, commonly known as Industry 4.0. The vertical integration of factory to implement flexible and reconfigurable manufacturing systems, i.e., smart factory, is one of the key features of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we present a smart factory framework that incorporates industrial network, cloud, and supervisory control terminals with smart shop-floor objects such as machines, conveyers, and products. Then, we give a classification of the smart objects into various types of agents and define a coordinator on cloud. The autonomous decision and distributed cooperation between agents lead the process achieving high flexibility. Moreover, this kind of self-organized system leverages on the feedback and coordination by the central coordinator in order to achieve high efficiency. Thus, the smart factory is characterized by the self-organized multi-agent system assisted with big data based feedback and coordination. Based on this model, we propose an intelligent negotiation mechanism for agents to cooperate with each other. Furthermore, the study illustrates that complementary strategies can be designed to prevent the deadlocks by improving the agents' decision and the coordinator's behavior. The simulation results assess the effectiveness of the proposed negotiation mechanism and deadlock prevention strategies.},

abstract = {This paper describes a framework for softwarebased networking in smart factories (SF) that enables them to easily adapt the communication network to changing requirements. Similar to cloud-based systems, such SFs could be seen as production clusters that could be rented and configured as needed. The SF network utilizes software-defined networking (SDN) combined with network functions virtualization (NFV) in order to achieve the required flexibility. This paper presents and discusses our vision of a network architecture for SFs based on SDN and network virtualization in order to support smart services especially for Industrie 4.0. Despite the fact that the technology is nowadays not yet ready for deployment in today's manufacturing networks, we present a framework for software-defined factory networks and discuss possible challenges and benefits.},

Factories have become more flexible than ever to complex modern market turbulence. Modern concepts of production systems require vertical and horizontal integration of all participants in the production process. This integration determines the foundation of a new, radical change in the mode of production by German industrialists called the industry is 4.0. In this, the smart production environment, structuring the smart factory. Smart factory is a production solution in a flexible and efficient way should be to meet the needs of today's market, and achieves integration between the various industrial and non-industrial partners who build dynamic, and very often and virtual organizations. This type of integration, linking the physical components of the production system and digital, abstract, virtual components into a single system called cyber-physical production systems. Systems are the backbone for the smart factory. Cyber-physical systems of production will be structured so that they can respond to almost any change in the market in time within really smart factories, but also beyond its borders. This not only makes production faster and in accordance with the specific requirements of individual customers, but also allows to production processes within the company are optimized through a network of global cooperation, adaptive and evolutionary and self-organizing. The potential for savings and innovation in these production systems and production operators is huge.

For Industrie 4.0 to come true, it is essential to implement the horizontal integration of inter-corporation value network, the end-to-end integration of engineering value chain, and the vertical integration of factory inside. In this paper, we focus on the vertical integration to implement flexible and reconfigurable smart factory. We first propose a brief framework that incorporates industrial wireless networks, cloud, and fixed or mobile terminals with smart artifacts such as machines, products, and conveyors. Then, we elaborate the operational mechanism from the perspective of control engineering, that is, the smart artifacts form a self-organized system which is assisted with the feedback and coordination blocks that are implemented on the cloud and based on the big data analytics. In addition, we outline the main technical features and beneficial outcomes and present a detailed design scheme. We conclude that the smart factory of Industrie 4.0 is achievable by extensively applying the existing enabling technologies while actively coping with the technical challenges.},
